My first attempt at a Speech Recognition App to test API use. However, the API wasn't working anymore so I went with a basic HTML, CSS, JS model using the Chrome browser SpeechRecognition API.
Based off Speech Recognition App Using Vanilla JavaScript by WEB CIFAR on YouTube, with the main template forked from TimCreative.
